## Credit

All WiFi promiscuous detection research — the **39-OUI Flock Safety target list**, the **promiscuous-mode strategy**, and the **addr1-receiver detection technique** — is the work of **OrdoOuroborous / @NitekryDPaul** (GitHub [@nitekry](https://github.com/nitekry)). The firmware here is a mod of his original work with added SPIFFS persistence and Flask-dashboard integration. Upstream OUI source: [nitekry/nite-oui-collection](https://github.com/nitekry/nite-oui-collection). Full research writeup: [`datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md`](datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md).

Additional research credit to **Michael / DeFlockJoplin** for the **wildcard-probe-request signature** and OUI `82:6b:f2`. Field-tested to 11/12 cameras caught with only 2 false positives in Joplin. Source: [DeflockJoplin/flock-you](https://github.com/DeflockJoplin/flock-you).

## What this branch does

Turns a Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 into a passive WiFi receiver that watches 2.4 GHz management and data frames for Flock Safety MAC OUIs. No AP, no transmit — the radio stays dedicated to sniffing while the device hops channels 1 / 6 / 11 at 350 ms dwell.

Every detection is:

- beeped (piezo on GPIO3) and flashed (onboard LED on GPIO21)
- written to on-device SPIFFS in an atomic CRC-envelope format, surviving power loss
- emitted as one JSON line over USB CDC in the schema `api/flockyou.py` expects, so the Flask dashboard auto-ingests it with GPS temporal matching

The device works standalone (no USB host needed) and plugged in (live dashboard) without any mode switch.

---

## Why promiscuous mode, and why `addr1`

Most WiFi sniffers only check the transmitter address (`addr2`). Flock infrastructure spends most of its duty cycle **asleep** — it wakes briefly in bursts, uploads, then sleeps again. During the silence it may never transmit a single frame in your capture window.

But it may still appear on the air as the **destination** (`addr1`) of probe responses or data frames from nearby APs.

Checking `addr1` in addition to `addr2` picks those silent stations up. It requires two guards to avoid false positives:

- `addr1` is broadcast (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`) in beacons and broadcasts — **multicast filter**
- Modern devices use randomised (locally-administered) MACs that can't be fingerprinted by OUI — **randomised-MAC filter** on byte 0 bit 1

Both are applied before the OUI match. This whole approach, including the 39-OUI baseline list (the 40th is DeFlockJoplin's), is **@NitekryDPaul's research**.

---

## Further research — the wildcard-probe signature (DeFlockJoplin)

Michael / DeFlockJoplin used the OUI + addr1/addr2/addr3 work above as a starting point and characterised what Flock cameras actually do on the air. His finding:

> The cameras are hopping channels and sending out a wildcard WiFi probe request on every channel. This specific type of request combined with OUI matching has created what seems to be a fairly unique signature.

His drive-test in Joplin caught **11 of 12 cameras** with only **2 false positives**. The 12th camera was doing the same wildcard-probe behaviour but with an OUI (`82:6b:f2`) that wasn't in @NitekryDPaul's original set — it's now in our list, credited to him.

The tightened signature that's active on this branch:

1. Frame is 802.11 Management, type=0 subtype=4 (**Probe Request**)
2. SSID Information Element (tag 0) is present with **length 0** (wildcard)
3. `addr2` (transmitter) matches the known-OUI list

When all three hit, we emit `detection_method: wifi_wildcard_probe` — the high-precision class. Non-probe frames from the same OUIs still emit `wifi_oui_addr2`, and the `addr1` receiver-side sleeper-catch still runs independently.

His proof-of-concept firmware (different enough we're not just pulling it in wholesale, but the core idea carried over cleanly): [DeflockJoplin/flock-you](https://github.com/DeflockJoplin/flock-you). The wildcard-probe analysis is his; we ported the detection into this firmware and kept our SPIFFS persistence, Flask JSON emission, and audio/LED feedback on top.

## Detection pipeline

```
  [2.4GHz air]
       │
       ▼
  wifiSniffer()                 ← IRAM promiscuous callback (WiFi task)
       │                          fast match only, no Serial / no malloc
       ▼
  alertQueue[32]                ← lock-free ring buffer (ISR-safe mux)
       │
       ▼
  drainAlertQueue()             ← loop() context, per-iteration drain
       │
       ├─► fyAddDetection()           ← always, every hit
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   fyDet[200]                 ← unique-by-MAC on-device table
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   autosaveTick()             ← every 60s when dirty
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   fySaveSession()            ← atomic CRC-envelope write to SPIFFS
       │
       ├─► shouldSuppressDuplicate()  ← 5s per-MAC serial-emit rate limit
       │
       └─► emitDetectionJSON()        ← USB CDC line for Flask
            buzzerBeep() + ledFlash()
```

The split between callback and loop is deliberate: the WiFi task has hard real-time constraints and cannot call `Serial.print` or `malloc` safely. The callback writes only to the lock-free ring buffer; `loop()` does all the heavy work.

## OUI target list (@NitekryDPaul research)

All lowercase, colon-separated. 40 Flock Safety infrastructure prefixes —
29 from @NitekryDPaul's original set, 10 from his April 2026 additions, plus
1 from Michael / DeFlockJoplin. `f8:a2:d6` from the original set has been
demoted as a Sony Media Player false positive, and `94:2a:6f` / `f4:e2:c6`
from the April 2026 additions have been demoted as Ubiquiti false positives
per @NitekryDPaul's June 2026 update (see
[`datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md`](datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md)).

Pre-compiled into a byte table in `setup()` so the matcher stays entirely in IRAM with no flash-resident lookups during callback execution.

## SPIFFS wire format

On-flash layout, atomic and crash-safe:

```
Line 1: {"v":1,"count":N,"bytes":B,"crc":"0xXXXXXXXX"}
Line 2: [{"mac":"...","method":"...","rssi":...,...},...]
```

Save procedure:

1. Compute CRC32 + byte count over the serialised payload
2. Write envelope header + payload to `/session.tmp`
3. Re-read and re-validate `/session.tmp` (CRC check)
4. Remove `/session.json`
5. Atomic rename `/session.tmp` → `/session.json` (copy+delete fallback)

Boot recovery:

1. If `/session.json` validates, promote it to `/prev_session.json`
2. Otherwise try `/session.tmp` (interrupted save)
3. Delete both working files, start with an empty live table
4. `/prev_session.json` stays around — host pulls it via `CMD:DUMP_PREV` (see "Host command protocol" below)

CRC32 uses the standard `0xEDB88320` polynomial so the same file can be verified on a host with any off-the-shelf CRC tool.

---

## Flask dashboard integration

The firmware emits one JSON line per detection in the same schema the BLE detector uses, so `api/flockyou.py` picks it up with zero changes:

```json
{"event":"detection","detection_method":"wifi_oui_addr2","protocol":"wifi_2_4ghz","mac_address":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff","oui":"aa:bb:cc","device_name":"","rssi":-62,"channel":6,"frequency":2437,"ssid":""}
```

`detection_method` values:

- `wifi_wildcard_probe` — **Probe Request + wildcard SSID from a known OUI** (the DeFlockJoplin high-precision signature). When this fires, the `addr2` broad alert is suppressed for the same frame to avoid double-counting.
- `wifi_oui_addr2` — transmitter-side OUI match on any non-probe frame
- `wifi_oui_addr1` — **receiver-side OUI match** (the @NitekryDPaul technique)
- `wifi_oui_addr3` — BSSID OUI match (mgmt frames only; disabled by default)
- `wifi_ssid` — SSID keyword match (disabled by default)

### Host command protocol

The firmware also accepts line-delimited ASCII commands on the same
USB-CDC port so Flask (or any host) can pull stored detections, query
device status, or wipe state without re-flashing. All commands are
terminated with `\n`; every reply is a single JSON object on its own
line, matching the existing `{"event":...}` schema.

| Command | Reply event | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CMD:STATUS`     | `status`           | Live counters: `fy_det`, `oui_count`, `spiffs`, `prev_session`, `uptime_ms`, `free_heap`, `channel`, `rssi_min` |
| `CMD:VERSION`    | `version`          | Firmware identifier + compile-time constants (`oui_count`, `max_detections`, `autosave_ms`) |
| `CMD:DUMP_LIVE`  | N × `detection` then `replay_complete` | Streams the current in-RAM detection table; each line has `"replay":true,"replay_source":"live"` |
| `CMD:DUMP_PREV`  | N × `detection` then `replay_complete` | Same shape but reads `/prev_session.json` from SPIFFS — i.e. what the device caught before the last reboot |
| `CMD:CLEAR_LIVE` | `clear`            | Empties `fyDet[]`; the next autosave overwrites the persisted session |
| `CMD:CLEAR_PREV` | `clear`            | Deletes `/prev_session.json` and any leftover `/session.tmp` |

A replayed detection line:

```json
{"event":"detection","replay":true,"replay_source":"prev","detection_method":"wifi_oui_addr2","protocol":"wifi_2_4ghz","mac_address":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff","oui":"aa:bb:cc","device_name":"","rssi":-62,"channel":6,"frequency":2437,"ssid":"","detection_count":17,"device_first_ms":12345678,"device_last_ms":18900000}
```

`device_first_ms` / `device_last_ms` are the device's monotonic millis at
the time of recording — useful for ordering, but not wall-clock. Flask
treats replayed entries as historical (`timestamp_source: device_replay`),
skips GPS temporal matching, and does not overwrite a fresher live entry
for the same MAC.

Flask exposes the protocol as REST endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Sends | Returns when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/flock/status`     | GET  | `CMD:STATUS`     | `status` event arrives |
| `/api/flock/version`    | GET  | `CMD:VERSION`    | `version` event arrives |
| `/api/flock/dump_prev`  | POST | `CMD:DUMP_PREV`  | `replay_complete` arrives (or 30 s timeout) |
| `/api/flock/dump_live`  | POST | `CMD:DUMP_LIVE`  | `replay_complete` arrives (or 30 s timeout) |
| `/api/flock/clear_prev` | POST | `CMD:CLEAR_PREV` | `clear` event arrives |
| `/api/flock/clear_live` | POST | `CMD:CLEAR_LIVE` | `clear` event arrives |

The typical "I just plugged the device back in after wardriving" workflow:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/flock/dump_prev
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/flock/clear_prev
```

The first call pulls everything the device caught since you last had it
connected and adds it to the cumulative dataset; the second wipes the
file from SPIFFS so the next run starts clean.

### GPS wardriving

GPS is handled Flask-side, since the ESP32 radio is dedicated to sniffing and there's no on-device AP. Two options:

- **USB NMEA puck** plugged into the host running Flask — Flask reads NMEA and timestamps a GPS timeline
- **Flask dashboard open in a phone browser** — browser Geolocation API posts updates to Flask

Flask does a temporal match between detection timestamp and GPS timeline, then exports JSON / CSV / KML for Google Earth.

### Running Flask

```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python flockyou.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000`, pick your serial port from the **Sniffer** dropdown, click **Connect**. Detections start showing up live.

### Dashboard command bar

Once the Sniffer is connected, five buttons appear next to the connect controls:

| Button | Firmware command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Pull Prev**  | `CMD:DUMP_PREV`  | Replays `/prev_session.json` (last boot's persisted detections) into the dashboard; entries get a purple **FLASH** badge |
| **Pull Live**  | `CMD:DUMP_LIVE`  | Replays the device's in-RAM detection table; entries get a blue **RAM** badge |
| **Status**     | `CMD:STATUS`     | Toasts a compact `det=N ouis=N prev=yes ch=N heap=KKB up=Ns` line |
| **Clear Prev** | `CMD:CLEAR_PREV` | Deletes `/prev_session.json` on the device (confirmation prompt) |
| **Clear Live** | `CMD:CLEAR_LIVE` | Wipes the device's in-RAM table (confirmation prompt) |

Replay detections are visually distinct — purple/blue badges next to the detection-method label, a subtle left-border tint on the card, and `timestamp_source: device_replay`. Replays don't get GPS temporal matching (the device's stored entries only have monotonic millis, not wall-clock) and never overwrite a fresher live entry for the same MAC. Every command response surfaces as a coloured top-right toast.

The dashboard is fully documented at [`api/README.md`](api/README.md) — endpoints, socket events, JSON wire formats, GPS setup, persistence layout, troubleshooting.

## Build and flash

Requires [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

```bash
pio run                     # build
pio run -t upload           # flash
pio device monitor          # serial output
```

`platformio.ini` and `partitions.csv` are at the root (1.9 MB SPIFFS partition, 6 MB app). No extra libraries needed beyond the Arduino-ESP32 core that ships with the espressif32 platform.

## Standalone vs connected

**Without USB:** device boots, plays the SMB 1-2 intro, starts scanning, stores every unique detection to SPIFFS, flashes the onboard LED on each hit. Plug in later — the prior session is sitting in `/prev_session.json`.

**With USB + Flask running:** same thing, plus every detection streams live to the dashboard as a JSON line. Flask adds GPS (if configured) and deduplicates across MAC, building the wardriving map as you move.

Both modes work simultaneously — the SPIFFS write path doesn't care if a host is listening.

## BLE companion firmware

The BLE-only sibling of this firmware lives on the [`main` branch](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/flock-you/tree/main). It detects Flock and Raven gear via BLE advertisements (OUI prefix, device name, manufacturer ID `0x09C8`, Raven service UUIDs), runs its own WiFi AP with a phone-facing dashboard at `192.168.4.1`, and emits the same Flask JSON schema. Flash both on separate boards for overlapping BLE + WiFi coverage feeding one Flask dashboard.
